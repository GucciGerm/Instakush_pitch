            <h1>User Interface</h1>
            <p>
                The user will enter the website through instakush.com and will be met with a simple interface of a list of dispensaries (left-hand side) and a selection of their top products.

            <h1>User Map</h1>
            <p>
                The user will be met with a map after they order their order. The map will display the status of when the order is accepted, when the "kush" (marijuana) is ready to be picked up, and when the courier (driver) is on the way for delivery for the user.
            </p>

        <section data-img="images/driver-map.gif">
            <h1>Driver Interface</h1>
            <p>
               The driver will have a map on the top of the screen. They will also have a list to click from different dispenaries with included estimated distances. When the driver clicks on a dispensary with a local order, the route to the dispensary will be loaded into their map.
            </p>

        <section data-img="images/order-popup.gif">
            <h1>Dispensary Interface</h1>
            <p>
                The dispensary interface will feature an order screen with a list of orders with unique id's that have yet to be fulfilled. When they are clicked on, the order will have a pop up that will display what the dispensary has to prepare for the incoming driver.
